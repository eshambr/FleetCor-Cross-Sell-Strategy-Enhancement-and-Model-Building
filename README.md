# Problem Statement

As we advance with the implementation of our Cross-Sell Program to promote the adoption of Universal Cards among existing Fuel-Only Cardholders, we face a significant challenge. Initially, customers who met the eligibility criteria and opted into the program have not consistently demonstrated the anticipated performance levels. In contrast, some customers who did not initially qualify have shown outstanding performance, evidenced by low risk and excellent payment histories. This discrepancy in customer outcomes necessitates a strategic reassessment of our program's criteria and procedures for opting customers in or out, ensuring alignment with our goals of optimizing customer engagement and program success.

# Approach

This project aims to improve FleetCor's Cross-Sell Program by blending data analysis with model development to enhance program profitability. The main goal is to refine the customer selection model to optimize eligibility. I carried out an extensive analysis of customer performance data, using three distinct predictive models. This approach helps identify customers with the highest creditworthiness and those most suitable for swapping into the Universal Card program, as well as determining which customers should be swapped out.

# Findings

In this project, I evaluated Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models to enhance FleetCor's Cross-Sell Program. The Random Forest model emerged as the most effective, providing deep insights into customer payment behaviors and account managementâ€”key factors for strategic decision-making and risk management at FleetCor. This model successfully identified 13 customers recommended for removal from the Universal Card program and pinpointed 601 potential candidates for inclusion. These actionable insights, accessible via the scripts, are projected to increase FleetCor's revenue by an estimated 15.60%.
